# Documentation Style Guide

## Descriptions
1. Descriptions will be formatted to be in an active voice, preferably without naming the function (e.g. the descriptin for sum would be "Adds numbers together")


## Arguments
1. The first word should be capitalized.
2. The description should include the acceptable input types (e.g. character vector, list, etc.)
3. The description should end with a period, except for descriptions ending in bulleted lists.
