\description{
Provides all character conversion methods of \code{\link[base:character]{base::as.character()}} and
additional methods for lists and data.frames. \code{to_character()} was created to
enable \code{\link[=collapse_to_string]{collapse_to_string()}} to handle many data types while avoiding unintended
conversions to character, which would have occurred if these methods were
added to \code{as.character()}.
