# Get Cited By List from PubMed

List PubMed publications citing those specified by `id`, optionally
split `by_id`.

## Usage

``` r
citedby_pubmed(
  id = NULL,
  web_history = NULL,
  by_id = FALSE,
  no_result = "warning",
  config = NULL,
  version = "2.0",
  retmode = "xml",
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- id:

  PubMed IDs for which to retrieve "cited by", as a character vector.

- web_history:

  An Entrez History object to be used instead of `id`, as generated by
  the modified
  [`rentrez::entrez_post()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rentrez/reference/entrez_post.html)
  fork at https://github.com/allenbaron/rentrez (see NOTE); should be
  used when "cited by" information is desired for \>200 IDs.

- by_id:

  Whether to split "cited by" publications by the ID they cite, as a
  boolean (default: `TRUE`); `FALSE` returns a unified list of *unique*
  cited by publications *without* reference to the ID they cite.

- no_result:

  The type of condition that should be signaled when no PubMed results
  exist in a response; one of "error", "warning" (default), "message" or
  "none".

- config:

  Configuration options passed to
  [`httr::GET()`](https://httr.r-lib.org/reference/GET.html).

- version:

  Argument included here for flexibility, but best left with the
  defaults as set; see
  [`rentrez::entrez_summary()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rentrez/reference/entrez_summary.html)
  for details.

- retmode:

  "xml" (default) or "json"; "xml" is preferred because of a higher
  response limit. This default is opposite the
  [`rentrez::entrez_summary()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rentrez/reference/entrez_summary.html)
  default.

- ...:

  Additional terms to add to the request, see NCBI documentation on
  [ESearch](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/#_chapter4_ESearch_)
