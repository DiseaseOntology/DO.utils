# Get Cited By PMIDs from PubMed

List PubMed IDs of publications citing those specified by `web_history`
or `id`, potentially split `by_id`. `citedby_pmid()` can handle cases
where the number of input IDs is \>200 automatically (unlike
[rentrez::entrez_link](https://docs.ropensci.org/rentrez/reference/entrez_link.html)).

## Usage

``` r
citedby_pmid(id = NULL, web_history = NULL, by_id = FALSE, config = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- id:

  PubMed IDs for which to retrieve "cited by", as a character vector.

- web_history:

  An Entrez History object to be used instead of `id`, as generated by
  the modified
  [`rentrez::entrez_post()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rentrez/reference/entrez_post.html)
  fork at https://github.com/allenbaron/rentrez (see NOTE); should be
  used when "cited by" information is desired for \>200 IDs.

- by_id:

  Whether to split "cited by" publications by the ID they cite, as a
  boolean (default: `TRUE`); `FALSE` returns a unified list of *unique*
  cited by publications *without* reference to the ID they cite.

- config:

  Configuration options passed to
  [`httr::GET()`](https://httr.r-lib.org/reference/GET.html).

- ...:

  Additional terms to add to the request, see NCBI documentation on
  [ESearch](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/#_chapter4_ESearch_)
  for a complete list.

## NOTE

The rentrez fork at https://github.com/allenbaron/rentrez implements
pull request [\#174](https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez/pull/174),
which is not yet implemented in the CRAN rentrez and is required for
rentrez::entrez_post() to function fully.
